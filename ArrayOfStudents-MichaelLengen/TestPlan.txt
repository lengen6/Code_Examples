Test Plan:

Input: Test the input validation. Leave name and grade blank. Enter a negative value, a value greater than 100, and a non integer to see if the logic catches these errors. Make sure the confirmation message comes up with the correct index position. Put a break in to see if the correct information is being added to each array. Try to enter more than 5 entries and see if the full array message comes up

Processing Check that the total and average calculations are correct by comparing them to hand calculations.
Check that the clear function clears the display and empties global variables and the arrays.

Output: Check that the display shows up correctly and that the string is being properly constructed in the loop.
