Test Plan: First make sure that the apporpriate values are being stored in the right variables by running debug mode and checking each value in the code line by line to insure accuracy. Next, check the calculations are running correctly by comparing the results of the program with results calculated by hand. Finally, make sure the highlighting feature is working correctly by trying out different combinations of college 1 and college 2 costing more, less, or the same as each other. Make sure validation is working on the numeric fields by leaving them blank and entering negative numbers.
