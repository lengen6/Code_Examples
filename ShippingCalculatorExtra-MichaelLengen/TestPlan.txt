Test Plan:

Validation: Enter blanks for package weight to see if logic is working. Enter a non numeric value for weight. Enter a negative number for weight. Select the different radio buttons to see that they are working. Don't select any radio button to check that validation and the error message are working.

Processing: Check calculations against hand calculations to make sure the results are accurate. Enter a total equal to 100 to see if cap logic is working. Enter a number greater than 100 to make sure cap logic is working. 

Clear function: Put a break in before the calculations run to see if the old values are being cleared.
